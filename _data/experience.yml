   Custom Wood Model Making
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    I worked as an apprentice wood model maker under the direct supervision of a Master Builder & 2 Journey Pattern Makers. I learned to work in extreme precision with specialy tools and instruments to create models from hand crafted and shaped molds of specific automotive or manufacturing parts for prototype testing and design. I was fortunate enough to work through a number of projects and transitioned into the CAD/CAM department to work more directly in design. I have a full mastery of the concepts, practices and requirements and possess the tooling experience to complete any model requirements. I worked on a number of projects for Saturn, Toyota, Cadillac and General Motors.
